# Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation of stock price dynamics using
Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). The model generates multiple simulated price
paths and visualizes their evolution over time with an animated plot, along
with the mean trajectory across all simulations.

## Features
- Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) price model
- Configurable drift and volatility parameters
- Multiple Monte Carlo simulation paths
- Reproducible results via fixed random seed
- Animated visualization using Matplotlib
- Mean price path overlay
- Vectorized NumPy computations for efficiency

## Run
```bash
python monte_carlo_simulation.py
